### Develop a model on theoretical basis
### Identify the dependent (response) and independent (predictor/explanatory) variables.

### Weeks of SP = f(Age, Years, AnnualPay)
### Weeks_SP = beta0 + beta1*Age + beta2*Years + beta3*AnnualPay + error

### Read the data
Pay <- read.csv("SolvedExample4.csv")

### Observe whether there is a linear relationship between each explanatory (independent)
### variable and the response (dependent) variable. Look for bending patterns.
### Bending patterns between explanatory variables and the response variable would suggest transformations.
### Plot a scatterplot matrix
plot(Pay) 
### OR
pairs(Pay[1:4], panel = panel.smooth)

### Correlation matrix
### Using correlation matrix, we can assess the strength and direction of correlation.
### The package Hmisc includes rcorr() function that displays r and the p-values.
cor(Pay)
### OR
### Use the rcorr function in the Hmisc package. This displays the r and p-values
Hmisc::rcorr(as.matrix(Pay))

### Observations from the Corrlation Matrix:
### Strong Positive correlation between WeeksSP and Age, WeeksSP and Years
### Weak Positive correlation between WeeksSP and Pay
### p-values matrix shows that the correlation between WeeksSP and Age is statistically significant
### WeeksSP and Years is statistically significant.
### WeeksSP and Pay is not statistically significant.

### Develop the multiple regression model.
Pay_Model <- lm(WeeksSP ~ Age+Years+Pay, data = Pay)
anova(Pay_Model)
summary(Pay_Model)

### Testing the overall model validity
### H0: beta1 = beta2 = beta3 = 0 (There is no linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.)
### H1: At least one beta(i) is not equal to zero. (There is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and at least one of the independent variables.)

### p-value for the F-test: 3.758e-12. The overall model is valid.

### This test measures the collective effect of all explanatory variables on the response variable.
### Since the p-value is approx. 0, we infer that the Age, Years, and Pay are jointly significant
### in explaining the variation in Weeks of Severance Pay.

### R-sq = 0.702. 70% of variation in Weeks SP is explained by variation in
### Age, Years, and Pay. The remaining 30% of variation is unexplained. 

### Adj. R-sq = 0.6825. 

### Estimated Regression Model
### SP_hat = 6.06 - 0.007*Age + 0.603*Years - 0.07*Pay

### Interpreting the coefficients.
### Intercept. The intercept is 6.06. This is the average Weeks of SP when Age, Years, and Pay are zero.
### This is meaningless.

### Age. The relationship between Weeks SP and Age is described by b1 = -0.0078. 
### For each additional year of age, weeks of SP decreases on average by 0.0078 weeks
### assuming other independent variables in the model are held constant.

### Years. The relationship between Weeks SP and No. of Years with the Company is described by b2 = 0.603
### For each additional year with the company, the no. of weeks of severance pay increases by 0.603
### assuming other independent variables in the model are held constant.

### Pay. The relationship between Weeks SP and Annual Pay is described by b3 = -0.0702.
### For every one thousand dollars increase in annual pay, the no. of weeks of severance package decreases
### by 0.07 weeks assuming other independent variables in the model are held constant.

### Testing the coefficients (t-test for individual coefficients).
### Null Hypothesis: beta(i) = 0
### Alternative hypothesis: beta(i) =/= 0
### t = (b(i) - beta(i))/se(b(i))

### Test of Coefficient of Age
### p-value = 0.9069. Not statistically significant.
### Not enough evidence to conclude that Age is linearly related to the No. of Weeks of SP.

### Test of Coefficient of Years
### p-value approx. 0. Highly statistically significant.
### Overwhelming evidence that No. of Years with the Company is linearly related to the No. of Weeks of SP.

### Test of Coefficient of Annual Pay
### p-value = 0.1864. Not statistically significant.
### Not enough evidence to conclude that Annual Pay is linearly related to the No. of Weeks of SP.

### Only No. of Years with the company is linearly related to the severance pay.

### Prediction Interval for Bill Smith. Age = 32 years, No. of years with the company = 10, Pay = $32,000
predict(Pay_Model, data.frame(Age = 36, Years = 10, Pay = 32), interval = "prediction", level = 0.95)
### Predict with 95% confidence 9.57 weeks of pay (point estimate)
### LCL = 5.63 weeks of pay 
### UCL = 13.50 weeks of pay.
### The offer of 5 weeks severance pay falls below the prediction interval and thus Bill is correct.

CarWash <- read.csv("SolvedExample5.csv")

### FULL MODEL: Contains ALL the independent variables.
### In this case, we have three - Price Discount, Radio Exp, and Newspaper Exp.
fullmodel <- lm(Sales_1000s ~ ., data = CarWash)

### REDUCED MODEL: Removes the independent variables to be tested.
### In this case, we have two independent variables to be tested 
### Radio Exp, and Newspaper Exp.
reducedmodel <- lm(Sales_1000s ~ PriceDiscount_Percent, data = CarWash)

summary(fullmodel)
summary(reducedmodel)

### The lm function does not provide us the SSEs for the full and reduced models.
### We run the anova function in R to get these.
anova(reducedmodel, fullmodel) ### Reduced model before full model

### OR you could display the SSE for the two models separately and calculate the F-statistic manually.

anova(reducedmodel)
anova(fullmodel)

### Conclusion and Interpretation
### The p-value from the ANOVA output leads to the rejection of H0
### H0: The reduced model and the full model do not differ significantly, so choose the reduced model.
### The reduced model and the full model do not differ significantly, so choose the reduced model.
### H1: The full model is significantly better.
### We conclude that the full model is better, so we infer at any reasonable significance level
### that the advertising expenditures on radio and newspapers have 
### a statistically significant influence on sales and should be included in the analysis.

### Partial R-squared
### SSE(reduced) = 2182.6
### SSE (full) = 1208.1
(partial_r_sq <- (2182.6 - 1208.1)/2182.6)
## The Radio expenditures and newspaper expenditures variables explain 44.64% of the variation in Sales that cannot be
## explained by PriceDiscount alone.
## OR
## The additional independent variables - radio and newspaper expenditures - in the complete model explain 44.64% of 
## the unexplained variation in the reduced model.
