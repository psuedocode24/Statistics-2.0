####MIDTERM####

####Question 1####

### Develop a model on theoretical basis
### Identify the dependent (response) and independent (predictor/explanatory) variables.

### Profitability_of_Banks = f(EfficiencyRatio, TotalRiskBasedCapital)
### Profitability_of_Banks = beta0 + beta1*EfficiencyRatio + beta2*TotalRiskBasedCapital + error

### Read the data
Ques1 <- read.csv("Community Banks.csv")
ROAA <- Ques1$ROAA....
EffiRatio <- Ques1$Efficiency.Ratio
TotalCaptial <- Ques1$Total.Risk.Based.Capital.Ratio....

### Observe whether there is a linear relationship between each explanatory (independent)
### variable and the response (dependent) variable. Look for bending patterns.
### Bending patterns between explanatory variables and the response variable would suggest transformations.
### Plot a scatterplot matrix
pairs(Ques1[3:5],panel = panel.smooth)

### Correlation matrix
### Using correlation matrix, we can assess the strength and direction of correlation.
### The package Hmisc includes rcorr() function that displays r and the p-values.
cor(Ques1[3:5])

### Observations from the Corrlation Matrix:
### Weak Positive correlation between ROAA and TotalRiskBasedCaptialRatio
### p-values matrix shows that the correlation between ROAA and TotalRiskBasedCapitalRatio might be statistically significant
### ROAA and TotalRiskBasedCapitalRatio might be statistically significant.
### ROAA and EfficiencyRatio is not statistically significant.

### Develop the multiple regression model.
Bank_Model <- lm(ROAA ~ EffiRatio+TotalCaptial, data = Ques1)
anova(Bank_Model)
summary(Bank_Model)

### Testing the overall model validity
### H0: beta1 = beta2 = beta3 = 0 (There is no linear relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.)
### H1: At least one beta(i) is not equal to zero. (There is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and at least one of the independent variables.)

### p-value for the F-test: 1.273e-14. The overall model is valid.

### This test measures the collective effect of all explanatory variables on the response variable.
### Since the p-value is approx. 0, we infer that the ROAA, Efficiency Ratio, and Total Risk Capital Ratio are jointly significant
### in explaining the variation in Profitability for the Bank.

### R-sq = 0.2785. 28% of variation in ROAA is explained by variation in
### Efficiency Ratio and Total Risk based Capital Ratio. The remaining 72% of variation is unexplained. 

### Adj. R-sq = 0.2712. 

### Estimated Regression Model
###Profitability_of_Banks = 1.395 - 0.011*EfficiencyRatio + 0.028*TotalRiskBasedCapital + error


### Interpreting the coefficients.
### Intercept. The intercept is 1.395. This is the average ROAA when Efficiency Ratio and Total Capital Based Ratio are zero.
### This is meaningless.

### Efficiency Ratio: The relationship between ROAA and Efficiency Ratio is described by b1 = -0.0011. 
### For each increase in the efficiency ratio, profitability of the banks decreases on average by 0.0011 productivity.
### assuming other independent variables in the model are held constant.

### Total Risk Based Capital Ratio. The relationship between ROAA and Total Risk Based Capital Ratio with the Bank is described by b2 = 0.028
### For each increase in total risk based capital ratio with the bank, the profitability of the bank increases by 0.028
### assuming other independent variables in the model are held constant.

### Testing the coefficients (t-test for individual coefficients).
### Null Hypothesis: beta(i) = 0
### Alternative hypothesis: beta(i) =/= 0
### t = (b(i) - beta(i))/se(b(i))

### Test of Coefficient of Efficiency Ratio
### p-value = 2.54e-07 Highly Statistically significant.
### Enough evidence to conclude that Efficiency Ratio is linearly related to the ROAA.

### Test of Coefficient of Total Risk Based Capital Ratio
### p-value approx. 0. 3.11e-07 Highly statistically significant.
### Overwhelming evidence that Total Risk Based Capital Ratio with the Company is linearly related to the ROAA.


### Both the Total Risk Based Capital Ratio and the Efficiency Ratio is linearly related to the ROAA.


### FULL MODEL: Contains ALL the independent variables.
### In this case ROAA is the dependent variable and Efficiency Ratio and Total Risk Based Capital Ratio are independant variables
fullmodel <- lm(ROAA ~ EffiRatio, TotalCaptial, data=Ques1)
anova(fullmodel)
###The p-value which is 6.653e-09 from the ANOVA output leads to the conclusion full model helps  infer at any reasonable significance level
### that the Efficiency Ratio, Total Risk Based Capital Ratio both have 
### a statistically significant influence on the ROAA included in the analysis.

#### Prediction and Confidence Intervals ####
predict(lm.RE, data.frame(ROAA = 0.60, TotalCaptial = 0.15), interval = "prediction", level = 0.95)

predict(lm.RE, data.frame(ROAA = 0.60, TotalCaptial = 0.15), interval = "confidence", level = 0.95)

####Question 2####

Ques2 <- read.csv("Caterpillar.csv")

#### Correlation Coefficient and Scatterplot ####

plot(Ques2$RM.Rf, 
     Ques2$R.Rf, main = "Risk Adjusted Returns versus Adjusted Market Returns", xlab = "Rm Minus Rf", ylab = "R Minus Rf")
abline(lm(Ques2$R.Rf ~ Ques2$RM.Rf))

cor(Ques2$RM.Rf, Ques2$R.Rf)

### If you want to find whether there is a correlation between Risk-adjusted Asset Returns and Risk-Adjusted Market Returns,
### use a two-tailed test.
### H0: rho = 0
### H1: rho =/= 0

cor.test(Ques2$RM.Rf, Ques2$R.Rf, alternative = "two.sided", method = "pearson")

#### Regression Model ####

R_Minus_Rf <- Ques2$R.Rf
Rm_Minus_Rf <- Ques2$RM.Rf

lm.CAPM <- lm(R_Minus_Rf ~ Rm_Minus_Rf)

anova(lm.CAPM)

summary(lm.CAPM)

#### The estimate for the beta coefficient is 1.7584 and its standard error is 0.1843. 
#### In order to determine whether the beta coefficient is significantly less than *one*, 
#### we formulate the hypotheses as H0: beta <= 1 and H1: beta > 1.
#### This is a non-standard case, so we cannot infer based on the T-Values and P-Values from R.

#### First, we need to find the t_critical value. We will use qt function in R.
#### Note the degrees of freedom (df) is n - k - 1 where k = number of predictors, which in this case is 1.

t_critical <- qt(0.05, 60-1-1, lower.tail = TRUE)
t_critical

#### Next, we need to find the t_test_statistic value.
#### t = (b - beta)/std. error

t_test_stat <- (1.7584 - 1)/0.1843
t_test_stat

#### Decision.
#### Since the t_test_stat is more than the t_critical, for a left-tailed test we reject the H0: beta <= 1.
#### We infer at 5% significance level that beta > 1 and is statistically significant.
#### Adjusted Risk Returns on  Caterpillar is less risky than the returns on the market.

#### To test whether abnormal returns exist, we test whether the intercept, alpha is significantly different from 0.
#### This is a standard case, where the hypothesized value is different from ZERO. So we can use the p-value reported 
#### by R.
#### Hypotheses are H0: alpha =/= 0 meaning there are abnormal returns, H1: alpha = 0 meaning no abnormal returns.
#### The p-value for the intercept is 0.0945 which is > any reasonable significance level.
#### So, at the 5% significance level, we can infer that alpha = 0 and Caterpillar has no abnormal returns.

####Question 3####
##Motivation: To infer that there are differences in household types among the three countries.
##Type Of Data: Nominal
##Level Of measurement: Categorical
##Statistical Test To Use: Chi Squared Goodness Of Fit Test.
##Hypothesis:
##H0: No household category is over-represented in the random sample of the families in the three countries USA, Canada and UK.
##H1: Atleast one household category is over-represented in the random sample of the families in the three countries USA, Canada and UK.
##Decision: As the p value is statistically insignificant thus the null hypothesis is rejected.
##Interpretation: Thus it can be inferred that atleast one household category is over-represented in the random sample of the families in the three countries USA, Canada and UK.
library(tidyr)
Ques3 <- read.csv("Household Types.csv")

df_Ques3 <- pivot_longer(Ques3, cols = c("U.S.", "Canada", "U.K."), names_to = "Country", values_to = "Household_Type")

df_Ques3 <- na.omit(df_Ques3)

chisq.test(df_Ques3$Household_Type, df_Ques3$Country, correct = FALSE)

mosaicplot(~ Country + Household_Type, data = df_Ques3, 
           main = "Mosaic Plot", xlab = "Country", ylab = "Household_Type",
           color = c(2, 4, 5, 3))


####Question 4####

Ques4 <- read.csv("Cost Control.csv")

### FULL MODEL: Contains ALL the independent variables.
### In this case, we have 4 - Paper, Machine, Overhead and Labor

o <- Ques4$OVERHEAD
p <- Ques4$PAPER
l <- Ques4$LABOR
m <- Ques4$MACHINE
c <- Ques4$COST

fullmodel <- lm(c ~ m + p + o + l)

### REDUCED MODEL: Removes the independent variables to be tested.
### In this case, we have two independent variables to be tested 
### Advertisement, Machine and Paper.
reducedmodel <- lm(c ~ m + p)

summary(fullmodel)
##By running the reduced model with the two variables Machine and Paper it's difficult to assess the variation in cost incurred by Ms. Levenworth.
summary(reducedmodel)

### The lm function does not provide us the SSEs for the full and reduced models.
### We run the anova function in R to get these.
anova(reducedmodel, fullmodel) ### Reduced model before full model


### Conclusion and Interpretation
### The p-value from the ANOVA  output or running the partial F-test gives a value of 0.4615 thus leads to fail to the rejection of H0.
### H0: The reduced model and the full model do not differ significantly, so choose the reduced model.
### The reduced model and the full model do not differ significantly, so choose the reduced model.
### H1: The full model is significantly better.
### We conclude that the reduced model and the full model do not differ significantly, thus choose the reduced model. So we infer at any reasonable significance level
### that the Overhead and Labor do not have 
### a statistically significant influence on cost incurred by Ms. Levenworth and they need not be included in the analysis.
###Adding one more port would increase the cost by b_1
